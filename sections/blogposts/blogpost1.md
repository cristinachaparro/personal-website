# My Story

Choosing at 18 what you’re going to be doing until you retire at 67 is awful and a mistake in today’s education and professional approach.
At 18 you don’t have enough experiences and you don’t know enough about the world to choose wisely – or as wisely as you would if you knew more. If you’re lucky and whatever you choose at 18 gives you a decent salary and you still like it when you grow older, that´s great! But sometimes that doesn´t happen.
That wouldn’t be such a big issue if it were slightly easier to change career paths midways, but nowadays, realizing that what you chose brought you straight into a precarious industry or that you don’t like it that much as to spend the rest of your life working on it, can be a big problem.

I studied English Studies at uni and I was - and am - very happy about it. I love every single thing I learned. Then I studied a master’s degree in Audiovisual Translation, Localization, Subtitling, and Dubbing – yes, I specialized on how to translate (mainly) films and TV shows. And I loved it too! I love languages, I love translating, and I find audiovisual translation specially challenging. Then I became a Project Manager in an agency, and it’s been almost 4 years since then, during which I’ve come to love this job I didn’t know anything about before applying.

What happened then? I realised it was a **precarious industry**. And, on top of that, that I would **never be able to opt to remote work** – which is key for me – unless I became a freelancer because this industry is not very modern - and freelancing can be even more precarious in translation; it wasn't an option.

So, I thought: I need to find something that I can learn relatively quickly, that ensures me a good salary, and that allows me to live my life as I want. Getting to this point was painful and stressing and I cried an awful lot, but it was also eye opening.

My boyfriend is a frontend developer, so it wasn’t difficult for me to get to The Idea: **frontend development**.

He had tried to talk me into it a few times before, he even suggested Adalab and tried teaching me a bit of Python four years ago, but it seems it wasn’t the right time, nor I had the right mindset because I wasn’t really interested and because I've always thought I'm not clever enough to learn anything computer related. I just ended up rejecting it.

But then COVID came and both my boyfriend and I started working from home. I had seen his screen other times before – and never cared to try to understand what I saw – but now I got to see it every day and he would just tell me “look, I did this” and then show me a cool graphic, or a design for a specific section of the website, and I was like “wait, do you… do you design websites?” Of course he didn’t, but he implemented the designs! I don’t know what the hell I thought he did, but I thought it was something full of maths and complicated commands that only a robot would understand.

But I still thought I was too silly. He would always insist that I didn’t need a degree on computer science and that anyone could do it, so I asked him to give me a few lessons and see if I liked it.

**And I liked it**. I liked it way more than I expected I would. I’ve always loved creating things, and this felt a lot like writing or painting… all in one. I wrote something, and _bam!_ I had it painted on my website. It’s so visual and it’s so easy to get the basics that I found myself avid to know more and learn more. I saw an opportunity, a new path for me.

So here I am. I started six months ago with a few courses in Udemy and a lot of 1:1 lessons with my boyfriend, and now I’m capable of creating my own website with HTML and CSS. I still have a long way to go, a lot of things to learn, a JavaScript to deal with, **but I’m on track**. It’s being hard sometimes, specially because my current job is quite draining so by the end of the day I’m beat. But if I know something is to persevere when I want something. I always try to give at least my 1% every day, because **1 + 1 makes 100% in the end**.

I’ll keep you posted on my advancements and I’ll try to share what I learn on my way in case it’s useful for someone else. If something helps me is knowing others have gone through the same as me before, so I hope to do the same.

If you have any thoughts or encouraging words to share with me, or maybe even a job post I could fit in, you know where to find me in the Contact section.

Thank you for reading!
