      Choosing at 18 what you’re going to be doing until you retire at 67 is
      awful and a mistake in today’s education and professional approach. At 18
      you don’t have enough experiences and you don’t know enough about the
      world to choose wisely – or as wisely as you would if you knew more. If
      you’re lucky and whatever you choose at 18 gives you a decent salary and
      you still like it when you grow older, that´s great! But sometimes that
      doesn´t happen. That wouldn’t be such a big issue if it were slightly
      easier to change career paths midways, but nowadays, realizing that what
      you chose brought you straight into a precarious industry or that you
      don’t like it that much as to spend the rest of your life working on it,
      can be a big problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied English Studies at uni and I was - and am - very happy about it.
      I love every single thing I learned. Then I studied a master’s degree in
      Audiovisual Translation, Localization, Subtitling, and Dubbing – yes, I
      specialized on how to translate (mainly) films and TV shows. And I loved
      it too! I love languages, I love translating, and I find audiovisual
      translation specially challenging. Then I became a Project Manager in an
      agency, and it’s been almost 4 years since then, during which I’ve come to
      love this job I didn’t know anything about before applying.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened then? I realised it was a
      <strong>precarious industry</strong>. And, on top of that, that I would
      <strong>never be able to opt to remote work</strong> – which is key for me
      – unless I became a freelancer because this industry is not very modern -
      and freelancing can be even more precarious in translation; it wasn’t an
      option.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I thought: I need to find something that I can learn relatively
      quickly, that ensures me a good salary, and that allows me to live my life
      as I want. Getting to this point was painful and stressing and I cried an
      awful lot, but it was also eye opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      My boyfriend is a frontend developer, so it wasn’t difficult for me to get
      to The Idea: <strong>frontend development</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried to talk me into it a few times before, he even suggested
      Adalab and tried teaching me a bit of Python four years ago, but it seems
      it wasn’t the right time, nor I had the right mindset because I wasn’t
      really interested and because I’ve always thought I’m not clever enough to
      learn anything computer related. I just ended up rejecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then COVID came and both my boyfriend and I started working from home.
      I had seen his screen other times before – and never cared to try to
      understand what I saw – but now I got to see it every day and he would
      just tell me “look, I did this” and then show me a cool graphic, or a
      design for a specific section of the website, and I was like “wait, do
      you… do you design websites?” Of course he didn’t, but he implemented the
      designs! I don’t know what the hell I thought he did, but I thought it was
      something full of maths and complicated commands that only a robot would
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I still thought I was too silly. He would always insist that I didn’t
      need a degree on computer science and that anyone could do it, so I asked
      him to give me a few lessons and see if I liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>And I liked it</strong>. I liked it way more than I expected I
      would. I’ve always loved creating things, and this felt a lot like writing
      or painting… all in one. I wrote something, and <em>bam!</em> I had it
      painted on my website. It’s so visual and it’s so easy to get the basics
      that I found myself avid to know more and learn more. I saw an
      opportunity, a new path for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here I am. I started six months ago with a few courses in Udemy and a
      lot of 1:1 lessons with my boyfriend, and now I’m capable of creating my
      own website with HTML and CSS. I still have a long way to go, a lot of
      things to learn, a JavaScript to deal with,
      <strong>but I’m on track</strong>. It’s being hard sometimes, specially
      because my current job is quite draining so by the end of the day I’m
      beat. But if I know something is to persevere when I want something. I
      always try to give at least my 1% every day, because
      <strong>1 + 1 makes 100% in the end</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll keep you posted on my advancements and I’ll try to share what I learn
      on my way in case it’s useful for someone else. If something helps me is
      knowing others have gone through the same as me before, so I hope to do
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any thoughts or encouraging words to share with me, or maybe
      even a job post I could fit in, you know where to find me in the Contact
      section.
