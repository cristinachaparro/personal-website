    <h1>My story</h1>

      Choosing at 18 what you’re going to be doing until you retire at 67 is
      awful and a mistake in today’s education and professional approaches. At
      18 you don’t have enough experiences and you don’t know enough about the
      world to choose wisely – or as wisely as you would if you knew more. If
      you’re lucky and whatever you choose at 18 gives you a decent salary and
      you still like it when you grow older, that´s great! But sometimes that
      doesn´t happen. That wouldn’t be such a big issue if it were slightly
      easier to change career paths midways, but nowadays, realizing that what
      you chose brought you straight into a precarious industry or that you
      don’t like it that much as to spend the rest of your life working on it,
      can be a big problem.
      <br />
      I studied English Studies at uni and I was (and am) very happy about it –
      I love all it taught me. Then I studied a master’s degree in Audiovisual
      Translation, Localization, Subtitling, and Dubbing – yes, I specialized on
      how to translate (mainly) films and TV shows. And I loved it too! I love
      languages, I love translating, and I find audiovisual translation
      specially challenging. Then I became a Project Manager in an agency, and
      it’s been almost 4 years since then, during which I’ve come to love this
      job I didn’t know anything about before applying.
      <br />
      What happened then? I realised it was a precarious industry. And, on top
      of that, that I would never be able to opt to remote work – which is key
      for me – unless I became a freelancer because this industry is not very
      modern (and freelancing can be even more precarious in translation).
      <br />
      So, I thought: I need to find something that I can learn relatively
      quickly, that ensures me a good salary, and that allows me to live my life
      as I want. Getting to this point was painful and stressing and I cried an
      awful lot, but it was also eye opening.
      <br />
      My boyfriend is a frontend developer, so it wasn’t difficult for me to get
      to The Idea: frontend development.
      <br />
      He tried to talk me into it a few times before, he even suggested Adalab
      and tried teaching me a bit of Python four years ago, but it seems it
      wasn’t the right time, nor I had the right mindset because I wasn’t really
      interested and because I always thought I wasn’t clever enough to learn
      anything computer related. I just ended up rejecting it.
      <br />
      But then COVID came and both my boyfriend and I started working from home.
      I had seen his screen other times before – and never cared to try to
      understand what I saw – but now I got to see it every day and he would
      just tell me “look, I did this” and then show me a cool graphic, or a
      design for a specific section of the website, and I was like “wait, do
      you… do you design websites?” Of course he didn’t, but he implemented the
      designs! I don’t know what the hell I thought he did, but I thought it was
      something full of maths and complicated commands that only a robot would
      understand.
      <br />
      But I still thought I was too silly. He would always insist that I didn’t
      need a degree on computer science and that anyone could do it, so I asked
      him to give me a few lessons and see if I liked it.
      <br />
      And I liked it. I liked it way more than I expected I would. I’ve always
      loved creating things, and this felt a lot like writing or painting… all
      in one. I wrote something, and bam! I had it painted on my website. It’s
      so visual and it’s so easy to get the basics that I found myself avid to
      know more and learn more. I saw an opportunity, a new path for me.
      <br />
      So here I am. I started six months ago with a few courses in Udemy and a
      lot of 1:1 lessons with my boyfriend, and now I’m capable of creating my
      own website with HTML and CSS. I still have a long way to go, a lot of
      things to learn, a JavaScript to deal with, but I’m on track. It’s being
      hard sometimes, especially because my current job is quite draining so by
      the end of the day I’m beat. But if I know something is to persevere when
      I want something. I always try to give at least my 1% every day, because 1
      + 1 makes 100% in the end.
      <br />
      I’ll keep you posted on my advancements and I’ll try to share what I learn
      on my way in case it’s useful for someone else. If something helps me is
      knowing others have gone through the same as me before, so I hope to do
      the same.
      <br />
      If you have any thoughts or encouraging words to share with me, or maybe
      even a job post I could fit in, you know where to find me in the Contact
      section.
